In "Is Divine Simplicity a Mistake", William Hasker argues that "the
strong doctrine of divine simplicity *is* a mistake, one from which
theology needs to be liberated." With this sweeping charter, Hasker
proceeds to critique the "traditional strong doctrine of divine
simplicity, attributed to Aquinas and before him to Augustine." The
strong notion of divine simplicity is riddled throughout with category
errors, logical failures, the "dehumanization" of God, and departures
from the broader traditional understanding of God's character.

Hasker begins with certain qualifications. "I speak here of views
attributed to Aquinas and Augustine because interpretations of their
views are bound to be controversial. I shall not undertake to resolve
those controversies."[^2] The project Hasker undertakes is not primarily
about the historical questions concerning the views of past theologians,
but about the truth of the subject-matter.

> I recognize, of course, that it is often important to establish as
> accurately as possible the exact views of some historical figure, even
> though this will not be the purpose of the present essay. But once
> that has been done, this accomplishment is merely preliminary to
> raising the question: Do we have good reason either to agree or to
> disagree with the thinker in question[^3]?

That Hasker is not engaged in historical research is clear from those
with whom he engages. Neither St. Augustine nor any historical authority
merits a single citation. St. Thomas Aquinas is cited few times, and a
historian of his thought has one fleeting quotation.[^4] Hasker does not
examine either Augustine's or Aquinas' accounts of what he means by the
terms "will", "knowledge", "love", "action". And although Hasker does
quote Aquinas' account of what he terms "simple simplicity"[^5], he does
not set forth Aquinas' (or Augustine's) formulations of the strong
version from which he seeks to liberate theology. Attention is paid
instead to the works of Eleonore Stump, Jeffrey Brower, and James
Dolezal.

Nor does Hasker wish to address the key components of the metaphysical
framework necessary to explain the traditional notion of divine
simplicity, at least in the work of Augustine or St. Thomas. He raises
the St. Thomas' postulate of the identity of God's existence and essence
only to say suggest it may involve a confusion of categories and quickly
move on, saying "we won't pursue this example."[^6] As any reader of St.
Thomas knows, St. Thomas' formulation of divine simplicity depends on
the identity of existence and essence in God, and any treatment of
divine simplicity that does not address this claim does not address
Aquinas' notion of simplicity. And Hasker raises a number of questions
that Aquinas himself raises as objections and then answers; yet Hasker
does so without any indication that he is aware of those discussions.
For instance, Hasker asks, if God is *actus purus*, "how can he be
free?"[^7] without giving any sign that Aquinas raises the question and
provides an answer in a number of places.[^8]

Had Hasker not held himself out as correcting the traditional views of
Augustine and Aquinas, the neglect of what Augustine and Aquinas
actually said would not be objectionable. Were Hasker's purpose simply
to limit his criticism to the recent and narrow confines of analytic
philosophy of religion where Augustine and St. Thomas have colored the
debate, little treatment of their views would be necessary.

Hasker does not observe these limitations. His goal, after all, is
grandiose: to "liberate theology", and he does not hesitate to pronounce
a verdict on Aquinas' motivation for the doctrine of simplicity[^9], or
to declare that truthmaker theory represents a genuine advance in the
traditional argument for simplicity,[^10], or to identify logical
deficiencies in the traditional formulations of simplicity,[^11] to
announce "we need to grasp the problem \[of divine cognition\] as it is
conceived by Aquinas and his followers"[^12], and to lay out "Aquinas'
perspective" on the individuation of actions. That Hasker is targeting
the view of St. Thomas is clear both from the judgments he makes in the
course of his article and in the light of his overall purpose.
Unfortunately this lets the paucity and inaccuracy of Hasker's treatment
of St. Thomas' views undermine his entire argument. It should be
uncontroversial that to criticize the position of another, one first
must understand it; and that as an academic, one must both characterize
it accurately and provide the textual grounds for that clarification.

*Next time: Is simplicity contradictory?*

    Dolezal all use St. Thomas as a resource in contemporary debates,
